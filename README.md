<h2> COVID-19 - Playing with Nature </h2>

Studying COVID by Playing with codes! 

<h3>  ðŸ’­ Background </h3> 
<hr/> 

Applying software technology to know more about covid-19 and biology. Internet isn't really providing a very clear view of how covid data works, so I decided to calculate it by myself. 

<h3> ðŸ’¡ What next? </h3> 
<hr/> 

For now the script only calculate the daily percentage of cases based on the number of tests in Italy. 
With <b> CalculateGenoma.ipynb </b> you can find the size in Byte of the COVID. Calculated based on the gonome(You can download it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512"> GenBank </a>) 

Now what's next with this funny project? 
* Script getting data from repositories and not from local files. 
* Expanding the data calculation 
* Calculating data of each country in the world 
* <b> But most important: </b> Coding an AI that can predict the next data by using our actual data

<h3> ðŸ’Š let's hack the nature </b> 

The project is public. Contribuite by helping with your big brain and let's hack the nature. hehe
